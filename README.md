Picture Gallery

A simple picture gallery app I created for one of the programming courses I've been taking. This app uses node.js, Express and a web API to create a one-page web app that fetches a limited number of picture data objects from the API (12 in this version) and displays them in a grid layout, together with information about each picture's author and picture ID. I use EJS to create the webpage, and the layout is mostly done with Bootstrap. There is an additional CSS file to further customise the layout from what could easily be done in Bootstrap. I think the changes could have been done with Bootstrap as well, but for this project I found it more convenient to simply use custom CSS.

This basic code could easily be altered to use a different API or a different layout, or include more options such as choosing the number of pictures to be displayed. I may try such modifications in the future.

As the app was done for a class in Finnish, the variable and function names are in Finnish, but for this public version I wrote the comments in English to make it easier to understand for non-Finnish-speakers.
